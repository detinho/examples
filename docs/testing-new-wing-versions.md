# Testing new Wing Versions

The [wing-sdk.yml](../.github/workflows/wing-sdk.yml) workflow is triggered for each new version of [Wing](https://github.com/winglang/wing) by the [Feedreader](https://github.com/winglang/feedreader/) app. This app is deployed in [wing.cloud](https://wing.cloud).

This is hooked up with the [wing-cloud-automated-testing](https://github.com/wing-cloud-automated-testing) user.
