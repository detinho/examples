# Hello Wing for the AWS CDK Target

The example from the [getting started](https://www.winglang.io/docs/start-here/hello) guide.

This is a simple example of a WingLang project that demonstrates the usage of cloud services. The program creates a cloud bucket and a cloud queue. It then adds a consumer to the queue, which writes a message to a file in the bucket.
