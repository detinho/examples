# Wing Typescript Example

This is based on the [Wing Typescript SDK](https://www.winglang.io/docs/typescript/) and demonstrates a simple function with testing.

The [my-ssr-framework.ts](./my-ssr-framework.ts) part could be easily swapped by something like [hono](https://hono.dev/) or [remix](https://remix.run/).
