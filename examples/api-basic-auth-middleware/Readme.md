# HTTP API with Basic Auth Middelware

This is a [HTTP API](https://www.winglang.io/docs/standard-library/cloud/api) example authenticating with Basic Auth. It's fairly similar to [api-basic-auth](../api-basic-auth/), except for the middleware approach.

Since this example makes use of external Javascript, it won't run in the [Wing Playground](https://www.winglang.io/play) yet.
